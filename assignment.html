<h1>Observations of Twitter </h1>
 <p style="text-align:center;font-family:courier;">
   During the attempts of collecting tweets, many problems occured.
   <br>First the maximum number of tweets that my database can store is around 2880 as it is showed in the picture below.
   <br><img src="html1.jpg" alt="visualization" width="170" height="100">
   <br>As a result we cannot estimate which is the acurate number of tweets per minute for a specific theme as well as we cannot draw conclusions
      for subjects with too general and too frequent keywords.
   <br>Furthermore the visualization number of tweets per minute cannot show tweets after around 13 hours of collections, so we cannot use this analysis for 
   long-terms findings.
   <br>Also, there was a problem with the keywords of tweets collected because it does not work alternatively but additively. For instance,if
   we want to find tweets for "New Year" and for "Greece" the collector will not assume tweets with both hashtags together but with either New Year or Greece. 
   <br><br>
   For these reasons I collected tweets of a greek match in football. (with teams PAOK-PAS GIANNINA).
   This match was helded in Sunday 8/1/2017 at 15:00. I started to collect tweets at 14:30 until .
   <br>My analysis was with keyword:paok . The observation that result is  
   <br>It is obvious that the tweets fluctuate with no stable way.
   
   
   
   These images referring to the number of Tweets per minute collecting during Christmas and New Year's Eve. The Mongo database was in operation at 25/12/2016 at 12:00-00:00 and at 1/1/2017 at the same hours. 
  <br>The keywords used in the jar file of Java Application was at the former time :Christmas,family and the latter :New Year's Eve,family .
